MyFeed
======

MyFeed is an RSS Feeds aggregator built on [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com/). It recognises your interests through your votes to the given article and creates a feed on the most interesting and recent articles on the feeds you have added. It uses the [TF*IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf) algorithm to find important keywords in each article to understand your interests. It supports webkit desktop notifications for realtime notifications of latest articles. It's simple and elegent design will not annoy you, like the other RSS aggregators do.
